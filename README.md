# reshaping
This a short tutorial I created for a colleague for reshaping morphological species data in R.

The first part I am creating a dataframe called k.data - this is just some dummy data I generated so that we were starting from a "raw dataset."  The second part I create ratios and make a new dataframe called ratio.data, just like you would want to do with your own data. I then re-shape it and plot it. You need to run packages ggplot2 and reshape2.
